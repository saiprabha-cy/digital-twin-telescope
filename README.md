# Digital Twin Telescope

A modular, end-to-end digital twin simulation framework for ground-based optical telescopes.  
The framework integrates physical optics, atmospheric turbulence, sensor modeling, sky simulation, and AI-based image reconstruction into a unified research pipeline.

---

## Motivation
Modern astronomical instrumentation requires integrated simulation environments that combine optical physics, atmosphere, detectors, and data-driven methods. This project addresses that need through a flexible and extensible digital twin architecture that supports virtual experimentation, algorithm development, and system-level performance evaluation.

## Key Components
- Optical diffraction and aberration modeling  
- Atmospheric turbulence and seeing simulation  
- Detector and sensor noise modeling  
- Realistic sky scene and catalog generation  
- AI-assisted image reconstruction  
- Interactive visualization dashboard  

---

## System Architecture
The framework models the complete telescope imaging chain:
Sky Model → Atmosphere → Optics → Sensor → Noise → Reconstruction → Visualization


Each stage is modular and can be extended independently, enabling future integration with real telescope data and hardware-in-the-loop experiments.
