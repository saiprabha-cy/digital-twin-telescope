# Digital Twin Telescope

A modular, end-to-end digital twin simulation framework for ground-based optical telescopes.
The framework integrates physical optics, atmospheric turbulence, sensor modeling, sky
simulation, and AI-based image reconstruction into a unified research pipeline.

## Motivation
Modern astronomical instrumentation requires integrated simulation environments that
combine optical physics, atmosphere, detectors, and data-driven methods. This project
addresses that need through a flexible and extensible digital twin architecture.

## Components
- Optical diffraction and aberration modeling
- Atmospheric turbulence and seeing simulation
- Detector and sensor noise modeling
- Realistic sky scene generation
- AI-assisted image reconstruction
- Interactive visualization dashboard
