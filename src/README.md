## src/

This directory is reserved for core simulation modules of the digital twin
telescope framework.

Planned modules include:
- Optical propagation and PSF modeling
- Atmospheric turbulence simulation
- Sensor and noise modeling
- Sky and catalog generation
- AI-based image reconstruction utilities

At present, the primary implementation exists in Jupyter notebooks and the
interactive dashboard. These components will be refactored into reusable
Python modules in this directory in future releases.
